## Tasks we should all be working on

1. Ben - Working on 'Add Review' functionality (the battery) and CSS (making it pretty)
- The backend (PHP) receives a POST data from the front-end, regardless of what the front-end's technology is (AJAX, pure HTML form, etc). It receives a number (float)

2. Maggie - Connecting to Mysql with PHP, making basic forms work (Maggie is working on this full crud)

3. May - Authentication System (May is working on this)

4. Interactive Front End (Javascript)

5. Project Description: Give a short description of your project. Many of these components can be used
from milestone 1 as it is.

6. Contribution: Summerize how how your team has split the workload throughout the semester. Provide us
a table containing four columns: Project Milestone, Team Member’s Name, Contribution, Contribution
% for that particular milestone.
(As we now know SQL, the primary key of the table is (project milestone, student’s name)!!!)

7. Summary: Summarize your learning from this project. Include which part was the most challenging to
implement, and which part was most fun (yes, the same component might be both fun and challenging).
Did you achieve whatever you planned in Project 1 Milestone 1. If you have drifted from the original plan,
why did that happen? All we want to see is how your project got evolved over time.

8. Future Works: How will you enhance your website if you get another semester? Note that this section is
no excuse for submitting an incomplete website.
